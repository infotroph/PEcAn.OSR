This is an add-on package for PEcAn, the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer, that allows it to set up, run, and collect results from the structural-functional plant root growth model OpenSimRoot.

PEcAn.OSR is experimental and still very incomplete, and I'm not sure yet whether it will ever be useful: We're trying to plug a tool designed for ecosystem-scale inferences over decades together with a tool designed for single-plant scale inferences over days. What could possibly go wrong?
